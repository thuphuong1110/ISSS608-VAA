The region is rich in mineral oil, gas, and fishery resources, making it a key driver of economic activity and energy security for multiple nations. On any given day, around 1,500 fishing vessels, tankers, and cargo ships navigate its waters.\n\nEffective ship performance management is crucial for ensuring operational efficiency, cost control, and environmental sustainability in this strategic area. Optimizing fuel efficiency not only reduces expenses but also minimizes emissions, helping vessels comply with environmental regulations. Regular maintenance can enhance ship reliability, but also need to balance with the cost of maintenance. Last but not least, understanding revenue and cost factors allows ship operators to make informed decisions that maximize profitability.\n\n## Objectives\n\nThis take-home exercise aims to use appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and visualization methods to provide readers with an overview of ship performance in the Gulf of Guinea, with a focus on the below areas:\n\n-   Examine the profitability of different ship type and engine type combination through **Revenue to Cost Ratio**\n\n-   Understand factors affecting ship **energy efficiency**: Ship Type, Maintenance status and Weather condition\n\n## The Data\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, the dataset [Ship Performance Clustering](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeleeladekunlefijabi/ship-performance-clustering-dataset/data) will be used, which is a simulated but realistic dataset that captures essential operational metrics and characteristics of different ship types in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nThe dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and stored in `data` folder under the same folder path with this Quarto document.\n\n# Set up R environment\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, the following packages are installed and loaded into R environment using `p_load()` of **pacman** package.\n\n\n\n:::

Taking a closer look, we notice there are \"None\" values instead in some of the columns. The below code chunk returns the number of \"None\" values in each column for columns where the count is larger than 0 using `summarise()` and `keep()` functions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnone_counts <- ship_raw %>%\n  summarise(across(c(2:18), ~sum(. == \"None\", na.rm = TRUE))) %>%\n  keep(~ . > 0)\n\nnone_counts\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 5\n  Ship_Type Route_Type Engine_Type Maintenance_Status Weather_Condition\n      <int>      <int>       <int>              <int>             <int>\n1       136        136         136                136               136\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe result shows there are 136 \"None\" values in 5 categorical columns: Ship_Type, Route_Type, Engine_Type, Maintenance_Status and Weather_Condition.

Next `corrplot()` is used to plot the corrgram of `ship.cor` using `method = \"number\"` (to show the correlation coefficients) and `type = \"lower\"` (to display only the lower half of the plot)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nship.cor = cor(ship[,c(6:8,11:17)])\n\ncorrplot(ship.cor, \n         method = \"number\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe corrgram above indicates no significant correlations among the numerical features, as the displayed values are close to zero and shown in white.\n\nGiven this observation, we will not proceed with further visual analysis of numerical feature pairs in the next section, as it is unlikely that any meaningful relationships can be identified.\n\n# Analytical Visualization\n\n## Profitability by Ship and Engine Type\n\n[*Ridgeline plot*](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/ridgeline.html) (also known as Joyplot), is a visualization technique that effectively reveals the distribution of a numeric value across multiple groups. They present a series of density plots or histograms, aligned on the same horizontal scale with slight overlap, allowing for easy comparison of distributions between groups.\n\n### Profitability by Ship Type\n\nFirst we look at the Revenue to Cost Ratio distribution by Ship Type as a profitability indicator to understand if there is any significant difference among the Ship types.\n\nThe below code chunk uses multiple functions to create a ridgeline plot segmenting the Revenue to Cost Ratio into four quartiles, providing insights into how different ship types perform across the distribution.\n\n-   `ggplot()`: initialize the ggplot object, declare the input data frame `ship` (using `filter()` to exclude Ship Type = \"None\"), and fill color by quantile using `stat(quantile)`\n\n-   `stat_density_ridges()`: plot ridgeline plot with gradient filled color\n\n-   `scale_fill_viridis_d()`: define the colour maps to be used for rigdeline plot\n\n-   `ggtitle()`: define main title, subtitle or caption for the plot\n\n-   `theme_ridges()`: a specially designed theme to make ridgeline plot looks better\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(filter(ship,Ship_Type != \"None\"),\n       aes(x = rev_to_cost_ratio, \n           y = Ship_Type, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE,\n    to = 15) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  ggtitle(label = \"Revenue to Cost Ratio by Ship Type\") +\n  theme_ridges(center_axis_labels = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Key Observations**\n\nThe plot reveals that 75% of all ship types have a revenue-to-cost ratio below 5, covering the first three quartiles. The distributions are approximately normal, indicating operational consistency but also limited opportunities for exceptional financial performance. However, the right-skewed nature suggests that while rare, some ships achieve significantly higher profitability.\n\nAmong the ship types, Tankers and Fish Carriers show slightly greater representation in the higher quartiles, indicating a tendency for higher revenue relative to cost. Further analysis is needed to determine whether this advantage stems from specific routes, cargo types, or operational efficiencies that contribute to superior financial performance.\n\n### Profitability by Ship and Engine Type\n\nSimilar to the above plot, the below code chunk uses `ggplot()`, `stat_density_ridges()`, `scale_fill_viridis_d()`, `scale_x_continuous()` and `theme_ridges()` to plot ridgeline plots of Revenue to Cost Ratios by Ship and engine type. Records where Engine Type is \"None\" or Ship Type is \"None\" are excluded. Additionally, we use `facet_wrap()` to arrange the plots into separate grid by Ship type.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(filter(ship, Engine_Type != \"None\", Ship_Type != \"None\"), \n       aes(x = rev_to_cost_ratio, \n           y = ship_engine_type,\n           fill = factor(stat(quantile)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE,\n    to = 15) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Revenue to Cost Ratio\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Ship_Type, scales = \"free_y\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Revenue to Cost Ratio by Ship Type and Engine Type\") +\n  theme_ridges(center_axis_labels = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=1056}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Key Observations**\n\nSimilar to the plots at ship types level, for all ship and engine types combination, the majority (75%) of revenue-to-cost ratios still fall below 5. All distributions are still right-skewed, indicating ships achieving exceptionally high profitability across al ship and engine type.\n\nFor Fish carrier and Tanker, Diesel-powered ships show a wider spread of the lower three quartiles, suggesting higher proportion of ships with high revenue to cost ratio compared to the other 2 engine types. For Bulk carrier and Container ship, Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) ships display slightly higher revenue to cost ratios than diesel variants, especially in the third quartile.\n\nNotably for Container ship, Steam turbine-powered shows a stronger skew towards higher revenue to cost ratio, suggesting this engine type may offer higher financial performance for Container ship, potentially due to higher fuel efficiency at certain operational loads.\n\n## Energy Efficiency Analysis by different factors\n\n### Efficiency by Ship & Engine Type\n\nTo assess whether energy efficiency is a key driver of profitability, we analyze its relationship with the Revenue-to-Cost Ratio. In this section, we examine ship energy efficiency, measured in nautical miles per kilowatt-hour, which enables fair comparisons across different vessels.\n\nThe below code chunk uses `ggbetweenstats()` function from **ggstatsplot** to create violin plots and perform one-way ANOVA test to compare energy efficiency across ship types.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = filter(ship, Ship_Type != \"None\"),\n  x = Ship_Type, \n  y = Efficiency_nm_per_kWh,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE) +\nggtitle(\"Energy Efficiency by Ship Type\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Key Observations**\n\nThe violin and box plots reveal that energy efficiency (measured in nautical miles per kWh) shows a relatively similar distribution across all ship types, with comparable spreads and medians. The ANOVA test result (p = 0.4) also suggests no statistically significant difference across ship types. All ship types exhibit bimodal or slightly skewed distributions, suggesting potential subcategories or operational conditions that influence efficiency.\n\nBulk Carriers have the highest mean efficiency (\\~0.82 nm/kWh), followed by Container Ships (\\~0.80 nm/kWh), Fish Carriers (\\~0.79 nm/kWh), and Tankers (\\~0.78 nm/kWh). However, the differences in mean efficiency are small, indicating that ship type alone is not a major determinant of efficiency. Given these observations, further analysis could explore other operational factors that may play a more critical role in ship's energy efficiency.\n\nWe proceed to examine energy efficiency by ship and engine type.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(filter(ship, Engine_Type != \"None\", Ship_Type != \"None\"), \n       aes(x = Efficiency_nm_per_kWh, \n           y = ship_engine_type,\n           fill = factor(stat(quantile)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Energy efficiency in nm per kWh\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Ship_Type, scales = \"free_y\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Energy Efficiency by Ship and Engine Type\") +\n  theme_ridges(center_axis_labels = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=1056}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Key Observations**\n\nDiesel engines exhibit higher energy efficiency for Fish Carriers, whereas Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) engines show better efficiency for Container Ships and Tankers. For Bulk Carriers, Steam Turbines tend to perform better, as indicated by a higher range in the third quartile of efficiency measurements.\n\nAs the differences become more pronounced, it suggests that engine type may play a more significant role in determining a ship's efficiency for different ship types. Further investigation could help uncover why certain engine types perform better for specific ship types, paving the way for optimization strategies to enhance overall energy efficiency.\n\n### Efficiency by Maintenance status\n\nShip maintenance and repair play a crucial role in the maritime industry, ensuring the smooth operation of the fleet with minimal disruptions. Regular maintenance can enhance operational efficiency and drives profitability by preventing unexpected failures and optimizing performance.\n\nTo analyze how maintenance status impacts energy efficiency, we use ridgeline plots to visualize the distribution of efficiency indicators across different maintenance statuses.\n\nThe below code chunk uses `ggplot()`, `stat_density_ridges()`, `scale_fill_viridis_d()`, `scale_x_continuous()` and `theme_ridges()` to plot ridgeline plots of energy efficiency Maintenance status, excluding records where Engine Type is \"None\", Ship Type is \"None\" or Maintenance status is \"None\". Additionally, `facet_wrap()` is used to arrange the plots into separate grid by Ship type.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(filter(ship, Engine_Type != \"None\", Ship_Type != \"None\",\n              Maintenance_Status != \"None\"), \n       aes(x = Efficiency_nm_per_kWh, \n           y = Maintenance_Status,\n           fill = factor(stat(quantile)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"Energy efficiency in nm per kWh\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Ship_Type, scales = \"free_y\")+\n  ggtitle(label = \"Energy Efficiency by Maintenance Status of Different Ship Types\") +\n  theme_ridges(center_axis_labels = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Key Observations**\n\nThe plot shows that for Bulk carrier and Container ship, ships in Good maintenance status tend to have higher energy efficiency, as indicated by their distribution shifting toward higher nm per kWh values. Interestingly, for Fish carrier and Tanker, ships in Critical maintenance status tend to have higher energy efficiency, which may require further investigation to understand the root cause.\n\nAcross all Ship types, ships with Fair maintenance status consistently show the lowest energy efficiency performance. However, the ridgeline plots do not exhibit strong, consistent differences across maintenance categories, suggesting that maintenance status alone may not be a key determinant of energy efficiency in this dataset.\n\n### Efficiency by Weather condition\n\nAccording to voyage intelligence specialist StratumFive’s CEO, Stuart Nicholls, weather conditions can impact up to 80% of a vessel’s performance. Given this significant influence, we analyze how energy efficiency varies across different ship types under three weather conditions: calm, moderate, and rough.\n\nRaincloud plots will be used to provide a combined view on both key summary statistics and probability density.

Among them, Container Ships show the highest median efficiency, suggesting they perform the best under calm conditions. For the remaining ship types, the median efficiency remains fairly similar, indicating that weather alone may not be a major differentiator in efficiency under calm weather condition.\n\nThe density distributions (clouds above the box plots) reveal that most ships operate within a similar efficiency range, but Bulk Carriers and Container Ships have a higher concentration of outliers on the upper end, suggesting that some vessels achieve exceptionally high efficiency. Conversely, outliers on the lower end are present across all ship types, indicating that certain ships struggle with efficiency even in calm weather, warranting further investigation into maintenance, operational factors, or design inefficiencies.\n\n#### Moderate Weather\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(filter(ship, Weather_Condition == \"Moderate\", Ship_Type != \"None\"), \n       aes(x = Ship_Type, \n           y = Efficiency_nm_per_kWh)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.1,\n               .width = 1,\n               point_colour = NA,\n               scale = 0.55) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .15,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.1, \n            binwidth = 0.05,\n            dotsize = 0.1,\n            ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ggtitle(\"Energy Efficiency by Ship Type in Moderate Weather\") +\n  theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Key Observations**\n\nThe overall shape of the density distributions remains similar to that in calm weather, indicating that moderate weather does not drastically alter ship efficiency. However, the broader spread suggests that moderate weather introduces additional operational challenges, leading to greater variability in performance across ship types.\n\nThe median energy efficiency values are more comparable across ship types than in calm weather. Interestingly, Container Ships, which had the highest median efficiency in calm conditions, now have the lowest median in moderate weather, suggesting they may be more affected by changing conditions. Tankers and Fish Carriers exhibit the narrowest interquartile range (IQR), indicating that their efficiency remains more stable in moderate weather. Conversely, Bulk Carriers and Container Ships show higher variation, with distributions extending towards both lower and higher efficiency values, suggesting that external factors from weather condition impact their performance more significantly than other ship types.\n\n#### Rough Weather\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(filter(ship, Weather_Condition == \"Rough\", Ship_Type != \"None\"), \n       aes(x = Ship_Type, \n           y = Efficiency_nm_per_kWh)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.1,\n               .width = 1,\n               point_colour = NA,\n               scale = 0.55) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .15,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.1, \n            binwidth = 0.05,\n            dotsize = 0.1,\n            ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ggtitle(\"Energy Efficiency by Ship Type in Rough Weather\") +\n  theme_economist()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Key Observations**\n\nCompared to moderate weather conditions, the interquartile range (IQR) has further widened across all ship types except for Bulk carrier, indicating increased variability in efficiency especially for Container Ships.\n\nThe right tails of the distributions remain prominent, showing that some ships still achieve high efficiency, but the density at extremely low values has also increased, suggesting that certain vessels experience a significant drop in efficiency due to weather-induced resistance. The median efficiency for Tankers has shifted downward significantly compared to moderate weather, indicating that rough conditions have a particularly strong negative impact on their energy efficiency.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe analysis reveals that Tankers and Fish Carriers tend to achieve better financial performance, with engine type playing a crucial role in revenue-to-cost ratio variations. While ship type alone does not significantly impact energy efficiency, engine type introduces noticeable differences, particularly for Bulk Carriers, Container Ships, and Fish Carriers.\n\nWeather conditions further influence efficiency variability, with moderate and rough weather amplifying fluctuations. Container Ships are the most affected by changing conditions, while Tankers experience significant efficiency declines in rough weather. Given these insights, further investigation into engine selection, maintenance strategies, and ship design is essential to optimize both profitability and energy efficiency under varying operational conditions.\n",
